"""
Download NBA data with nba_api and save it to SQLite.

Run from the project's main folder (with the venv active):
    python -m src.data_pull

Creates three tables in the database at config.DB_PATH:
    player_seasons  one row per player per season (season totals)
    team_seasons    one row per team per season (wins, losses, win %)
    players         one row per player (position, draft info)

Seasons already in the database are skipped, so rerunning is fast.
To re-download everything, delete the database file and run again.
